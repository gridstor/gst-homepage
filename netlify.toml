# Shared Authentication Configuration
# Environment Variables needed:
# SITE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here (same value across all sites)

# Cookie Configuration for shared auth:
# - Cookie name: site-auth
# - Settings: httpOnly, secure, sameSite: 'strict'
#
# Netlify Dashboard Configuration:
# Set password in Site Settings > Access control > Password protection
# IMPORTANT: For seamless proxy to work, ensure:
# 1. Password protection is set to "Visitor access" not "Deploy previews"
# 2. No conflicting edge functions that might interfere with /dayzer paths

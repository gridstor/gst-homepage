# Shared Authentication Configuration
# Environment Variables needed:
# SITE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here (same value across all sites)
# 
# Cookie Configuration for shared auth:
# - Cookie name: site-auth
# - Settings: httpOnly, secure, sameSite: 'strict'
#
# Netlify Dashboard Configuration:
# Set password in Site Settings > Access control > Password protection
# IMPORTANT: For seamless proxy to work, ensure:
# 1. Password protection is set to "Visitor access" not "Deploy previews"
# 2. No conflicting edge functions that might interfere with /market-ops paths

# These legacy routes have been moved - see "New Navigation Structure" section below for current routes

# Comprehensive proxy configuration for assets and routes
# Order matters! More specific rules first, then general fallbacks

# NOTE: Asset routing is now handled by the Edge Function (asset-proxy.ts)
# The Edge Function intelligently routes /_astro/* and /assets/* based on the referer header
# This allows each proxied page to load its correct assets dynamically
